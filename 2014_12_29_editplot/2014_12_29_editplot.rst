plotedit
--------

plotedit() can be used to enable editing of a plot. The first time I took interest in the function was when I was considering enabling a height resizing feature for multiple axes. The idea was to resize a single axes and to have a listener that subsequently resized the other axes to accomodate the change in size of the given axes

?When was this feature first available?

Lessons Learned
---------------

1. plotedit can be applied directly to axes

plotedit(gca)

2. plotedit(handle,'isactive') specifies the active state. Unfortunately this only seems to apply to the figure. Perhaps there is an alternative property which specifies which part of the figure is active.
